/**
 * @AF: A review is created by the parameters: reviewId, businessId, userId,
 *      text, star rating, date created. The reviewRating characteristics
 *      (funny, cool, useful) can be added as people vote for the review. The
 *      review requires a businessId and a userId because a user must write the
 *      review, and the review must be assigned to a business.
 * 
 * 
 * @RI : UserId, BusinessId, and ReviewId, cannot be null, and the reviewId must
 *     be unique in the database. The date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format, and
 *     cannot be null. Stars cannot be null, and has to be an integer from 1 to
 *     5. Text must be a string, and not null, but does not have a character
 *     limit. A user can only write 1 review per business.
