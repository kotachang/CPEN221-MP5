Design Choices for Database
===

We will start by exploring a generic dataset for a business. We will declare 3 main data types:
+ Business
+ Review
+ User

For each we will have different associated properties.

### Review
# Price
+ This is a rating of the price of the service provided by this business.
+ For example, how expensive the food was, how expensive the printers were compared to other stores, how expensive the massage was compared to other masseuse.

## Subtyping to a Restuarant

To subtype the "Business" type to a "Restuarant" we only need to make adjust some of the subtypes for the Business type.
+ Type of Product -> Types of food (Chinese, Mexican, Burgers etc)

All of the other characteristics are basically the same. Having the general business type allows for easy development of the restuarant subtype.
